This article's objective is to declare upfront what you can expect of the articles hosted on this site; their objective, their motivations, their content.

This site being the entrypoint and/or homepage of my professional online activity, the articles it hosts should be expected to be aligned to this site's objectives.

## Expressing through work
One of the objectives of the site is to contain links to my core, actual work: engineering projects.
These projects will then be somewhat of an expression about my professional inclinations to the visitor, but will not show the whole picture.
This is where the articles come handy: to fill the expression gaps.
My preferences, ideals and approaches to software development and technology will then hopefully be expressed to a decent degree.

## Articles content
The subjects I will be writing about may range from apparently silly software-related discussions to more serious, complex stuff.
Regarding the article's objectives and motivations, the reasons to write about something may include
that I wanted to increase awareness about something I consider important,
or that I wanted to prove that I understand or can do something in particular.

I expect the number of articles to stabilize within a year, after which I will most likely be sporadically updating existing articles rather than adding new ones.
That is because my ideas will (hopefully) get slightly better, but my professional core values will (probably) not change significantly.

## I am not a writer
I do not consider myself a writer and, while I do enjoy writing, I certainly doubt writing about software or technology is the best thing I can do at this stage of my career.
Not being a writer, I do not expect to make money out of these articles (again, they are not the core of my job!).
I will therefore not put ads, cookies or include comments sections on this site.

## It is not a blog!
Lastly, and because of all the reasons above, I would not call this site a blog.
Even though I do realize it will be difficult to argue it is not one!
