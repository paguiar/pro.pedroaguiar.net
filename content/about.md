## Professional Me

My name is Pedro Aguiar.
I am very passionate about software and quite interested in other technologies (they most likely involve software after all!).
I am a Mechatronics Engineering graduate.
I believe technology can change the world for the best, and that is humanity's responsibility to make that happen.

I was born and grew up in Ensenada (Mexico), where I lived until the age of 18.
I studied Mechatronics in Monterrey (Mexico) and worked there for a couple of years.
I moved to Grenoble (France) when I was 24, where I hold a position as an R&D Software Engineer.

## This site

I very recently decided that I wanted to increase my professional online presence to allow me to achieve my medium and long-term goals.
This site is the entrypoint, index and/or homepage of this presence;
the first stop to which I will redirect people to whom I am interested in professionally-connecting with.

This site is the place to have a glimpse into my **professional**, publicly-shared ideas and skills.
Note that by *professional* I do not mean *technical*;
I do plan to write about the *moral* and *social* implications of my work.
What I do mean is that I will not share *personal*, *emotional* and/or *religious* ideas in this site.
This is not to undermine all those very important dimensions of life;
I just decided my ideas on those subjects belong elsewhere in the internet.

Last but not least, this site is a work in progress and at an early stage.
I just do not want to wait until I have done a lot to begin publishing stuff to the internet.
